## Introduction
The Fitness Tracker Data Engineering project aims to process and analyze fitness tracker data to derive actionable insights that can help businesses in the fitness industry understand user behavior, optimize product offerings, and improve customer engagement. By leveraging Apache Spark, Scala, Docker, and IntelliJ, this project demonstrates how modern data engineering techniques can be used to transform raw data into valuable business intelligence.

## Objectives
**Data Ingestion:** Efficiently read and loaded raw fitness tracker data from a CSV file into a Spark DataFrame.
Data Transformation: Cleaned, formatted, and transformed the data to ensure consistency and usability for analysis.
Data Analysis: Conduced detailed analyses to extract insights on user activity patterns, calorie consumption, and popular activities, which can be used to inform business decisions.

## Business Problem
A Fitness tracker companies collect vast amounts of data on user activities and health metrics. However, this raw data is often underutilized due to its complexity and volume. The goal of this project is to:

**Understand User Behavior:** Identified patterns in user activities to tailor fitness programs and product recommendations.
**Optimize Product Offerings:** Determined which activities are most popular among different demographics to enhance product features and marketing strategies.
**Improve Customer Engagement:** Used insights on user activity and calorie consumption to develop personalized fitness plans and recommendations.

## Tech Stack
**Apache Spark:** For distributed data processing and analysis.
**Scala:** For efficient data manipulation and functional programming.
**Docker:** To create a reproducible and consistent development environment.
**IntelliJ IDEA:** As the IDE for development, debugging, and testing.

## Key Components
**Data Ingestion:** Loaded raw fitness tracker data from a CSV file using Sparkâ€™s DataFrame API, ensuring efficient handling of large datasets.

**Data Transformation:**
**Activity Column Formatting:** I Standardized activity names by removing underscores and renaming columns for consistency.
**Timestamp Formatting:** I Converted timestamp strings into proper timestamp data types to enable accurate time-based analysis.
**Data Analysis:**
**Calorie Burn Analysis:** Aggregate and rank users based on total calories burned, helping to identify the most active users.
**Activity Analysis Among Females:** Determine the most popular activities among female users using both DataFrame API and SQL queries, providing insights into gender-specific preferences.

## Detailed Analysis Approach
**Calorie Burn Analysis:**
- Aggregated total calories burned by each user to identify top performers.
- Used this data to tailor advanced fitness programs for high-performing users, enhancing user satisfaction and retention.

**Activity Analysis Among Females:**
- Filtered data to focus on female users.
- Grouped activities by popularity to understand preferences and tailor marketing strategies.
- Used SQL-style queries to validate results and ensure consistency.

**Conclusion**
This project demonstrates how advanced data engineering techniques can be applied to transform raw fitness tracker data into actionable business insights. By using Apache Spark and Scala, the project efficiently handles large datasets, performs complex transformations, and conducts detailed analyses. Docker ensures a consistent development environment, while IntelliJ IDEA provides a robust platform for code development. The insights gained from this project can help fitness companies understand user behavior, optimize product offerings, and improve customer engagement, ultimately driving business growth.
